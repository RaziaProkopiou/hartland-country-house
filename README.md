## Getting Started

To run the website locally for development or testing:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RaziaProkopiou/hartland-country-house.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (no server required for static viewing).

For the original Node.js setup (if needed):

- Ensure Node.js is installed.
- Run `npm install` (though not required for the demo).
- Start the server with `node server.js` and visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Notes

This demo represents the website as delivered during the original engagement. It is not actively maintained and may differ from any previous or future live versions.

- **Contact Form**: The contact form is for demonstration purposes only and does not send emails (EmailJS integration was planned but not implemented).
- **Book Now Buttons**: The "Book Now" buttons are placeholders and do not link to a functional booking engine.
- All content, images, and branding remain the property of the client and are displayed here for portfolio demonstration purposes only.
